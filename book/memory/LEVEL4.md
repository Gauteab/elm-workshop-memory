## Level 4 - The game!

In memory, as you may know, the player opens two cards, one after another, and if they match they stay open.
If they do not match, both cards are closed again.
This repeats until all cards on the board are open. Before we start implementing the game logic, let's clean up a bit.

### 4.1 Housekeeping part one

Our deck of cards is a list of `Card`s and we will be passing them around in our program.
Therefore, instead of having to write `List Card` everywhere, we want to be able to write `Deck`.

Also, in the game we will be matching pairs of cards with each other, and will need some way to distinguish between two cards with the same image.
We will do this by saying that a card can be _either_ in group `A` or in group `B`. Use a custom type to achieve this, and add it as a field in our `Card` type.
With this we can check if two cards are of one pair by comparing their `id` and `group` fields!

---

**Task:**

-   Create a type alias for our deck of cards.
-   Create a custom type for representing the group of a card.
-   Add `group` as a field in our `Card` type

### 4.2 Housekeeping part two

By now our `Main.elm` file is getting quite big, so we should probably do something about that.
It is common in Elm projects to have the application's model and associated types in their own file(s), so let's try that.

---

**Task:**

1. Move all types and type aliases to the file `Model.elm`
    - See [Note on modules](#note-on-modules) below
1. To use our types in `Main.elm` we also need to import them. This is done in the same way as we import the `Html` module (`import Html exposing (..)`)

In addition to this, let's pretend we're famous TV chefs and cheat a little bit. We have prepared a module `DeckGenerator` that can be used to generate a deck of cards.
Use this by importing `DeckGenerator` in `Main.elm` and using the `DeckGenerator.static` value as `model`'s initial value.

> ### Note on modules
>
> A module's name must match its filename.
> For example:
>
> -   Filename: `GameLogic.elm` -> module name: `GameLogic`
> -   Filename: `Models/User.elm` -> module: `Models.User`
>
> You must also be explicit with what your module exposes to the public by listing them along with the module declaration.
> For type aliases and functions you just list their names, but for custom types you have two choices:
>
> -   exposing _only the type_ (often called opaque types)
> -   exposing both the type and its constructors.
>
> When exposing only the type you list its name, but when you expose its constructors too you add `(..)` after the type name.
>
> Example:
>
> ```elm
> module MyModule exposing (MyTypeAlias, myFunction, MyCustomType(..), MyOpaqueCustomType)
>
> type alias MyTypeAlias = { name : String }
>
> myFunction : Int -> Int
> myFunction number
>   = number * 2
>
> type MyCustomType
>   = Foo
>   | Bar Int
>
> type MyOpaqueCustomType
>   = MyOpaqueCustomType { name : String }
> ```

### 4.3 Game logic!

Our game implementation will have three states:

1. `Choosing` - the player chooses the first card
1. `Matching` - the player chooses the second card to match with the first
1. `GameOver` - all cards are matched and the player has won

The game logic will flow like this:

1. When the player chooses the first card he is in the `Choosing` state:
    1. Set all unmatched cards to `Closed`
    1. Set the chosen/clicked card to `Open`
    1. Go to `Matching` state
1. In the `Matching` state, the player chooses his second card:
    1. If it matches the first card, then set the two cards to `Matched`. If the two cards do not match, set the clicked card to `Open`.
1. If all cards are `Matched`, then go to `GameOver` state, else go to `Choosing` state

The `Model` of our program should now change from consisting of just a `Deck`Â to being a `GameState`.
We also need a function that can handle the three different `GameState`s.
It should have the signature `updateCardClick : Card -> GameState -> GameState`.

---

**Task:**

-   Implement the three game states as a custom type called `GameState`
-   Implement the `updateCardClick : Card -> GameState -> GameState` function
-   Update your `update` and `view` functions to accommodate for the new shape of our model
-   Now take a minute and pat yourself on the back for making an awesome game in Elm!

**Hint:**

The `GameOver` state does not need any extra data, but `Choosing` needs a `Deck` (the deck we are choosing from), and `Matching` needs both a `Card` (the card we are trying to match with) and a `Deck` (the deck we are choosing from).

When implementing `updateCardClick` there are a couple of things that will help:

1. You can create a function `closeUnmatched : Deck -> Deck` that, as its name implies, sets all cards that are not `Matched` to `Closed`
1. You can use the built-in function `List.all : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> Bool` to check if all cards are are matched
1. The `setCardState : CardState -> Card -> Card` can be changed to operate on a `Deck` instead; `setCardState : CardState -> Card -> Deck -> Deck`. This will fit nicely with using Elm's "pipe operator"
1. The "pipe operator" ([`|>`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#|>)) is great when you have multiple functions that all depend on the result of the previous function.
   For example:

```elm
myString =
    String.toUpper (String.repeat 2 (String.reverse "olleh"))
-- myString == "HELLOHELLO"
```

can be written as

```elm
myString =
    "olleh"
        |> String.reverse
        |> String.repeat 2
        |> String.toUpper
-- myString == "HELLOHELLO"
```

In short: `myFunction myArgument == myArgument |> myFunction`.
This will prove useful with the updated `setCardState` function.

1. "Let expressions" is a way of storing intermediate values (kind of like variables).
   The above example can also be written as:

```elm
myString =
    let
        reversed = String.reverse "olleh"
        repeated = String.repeat 2 reversed
    in
    String.toUpper repeated
-- myString == "HELLOHELLO"
```

It's a way of saying "**_Let_** `reversed` and `repeated` be defined **_in_** the following expression but nowhere else".

> Refreshing the page every time you want to play another game is boring, so try to add a "restart game" button in the "Game over" view. Hint: it is common to have a top-level value called `init` that contains the initial state of the `model`.
